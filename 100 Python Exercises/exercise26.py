#Question
'''
Make a script that prints out
numbers from 1 to 10.

Hint: Simply iterate through a range object.
'''
#Answer:
'''
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

Explanation:

A for  loop is used to repeat an action (i.e. print ) until the iterating
sequence (i.e. range ) is consumed. In our case it would print all items of
the range one by one.
