### PROJECT: BASKETBALL FREE THROW TRENDS ###
---------------------------------------------
'''
You have been supplied data for two more additional in-game statistics:
    • Free Throws
    • Free Throw Attempts

You need to create three plots that portray the following insights:
    • Free Throw Attempts per game
    • Accuracy of Free Throws
    • Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws*

*Each Free Throw is worth 1 point
The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. You will have to create
the two matrices before you proceed with the analysis

Seasons are labeled based on the first year in the season
E.g. the 2012-2013 season is preseneted as simply 2012

Notes and Corrections to the data:
    Kevin Durant: 2006 - College Data Used
    Kevin Durant: 2005 - Proxied With 2006 Data
    Derrick Rose: 2012 - Did Not Play
    Derrick Rose: 2007 - College Data Used
    Derrick Rose: 2006 - Proxied With 2007 Data
    Derrick Rose: 2005 - Proxied With 2007 Data

'''
Because we have excluded free throws, this plot now shows us the true representation of player style change.
We can verify that this is the case because all the marks without exception on this plot are between 2 and 3.
That is because Field Goals can only be for either 2 points or 3 points.

Insights:

You can see how players' preference for 2 or 3 point shots changes throughout their career.
We can see that almost all players in this dataset experiment with their style throughout their careers.
Perhaps, the most drastic change in style has been experienced by Joe Johnson.

There is one exception. You can see that one player has not changed his style at all - almost always scoring only 2-pointers.
Who is this mystert player? It's Dwight Howard! Now that explains a lot.
The reason that Dwight Howard's Field Goal accuracy is so good is because he almost always scores 2-pointers only.
That means he can be close to the basket or even in contact with it.
Free throws, on the other hand require the player to stand 15ft (4.57m) away from the hoop.
That's probably why Dwight Howard's Free Throw Accuracy is poor.
